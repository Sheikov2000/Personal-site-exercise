          <h2>Hello!</h2>
          <p class="intro">Besides music, I love coffee and craft beer! I am an audiophile with a huge collection of music records. Last but not least, I am into 3D printing, and radio controlled airplanes! Oh, did I forget something? Software development, of course!</p>

            <h3>Music and Software</h3>
            <p>The core of my skills lays in Early Classical Music - everything from understanding the theoretical foundations to interpreting some of the most sophisticated keyboard works written for the harpsichord. As I transition into web development, my skill set is growing every day! Soon I hope I can list very specific coding skills!</p>

            <h3>Things I enjoy in my free time</h3>
            <p>In every professional stage of my life, I believe a balance of time spent off from working is essential for a productive flow. When I am not in front of a harpsichord, or at my computer, I like to go out and pilot RC airplanes. This requires a lot of skill and has a steep learning curve. Very much like learning a music instrument, or coding! Good things take a lot of work.</p>
